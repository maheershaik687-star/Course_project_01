Attendance Management
Abstract

A simple, file-based Attendance Management program in C that stores student info in students.txt and daily attendance in attendance.csv. It provides a console menu to add/view students, mark attendance for the current date, view attendance by date, and compute an individual student’s attendance percentage. The program is lightweight, requires no external libraries, and persists data between runs using plain text files.
